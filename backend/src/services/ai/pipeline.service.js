/**
 * The pipeline. One function, one turn of conversation.
 *
 *   message
 *     -> intent + safety            deterministic, no network
 *     -> crisis short-circuit       never reaches a recommendation
 *     -> retrieval                  approved knowledge only
 *     -> confidence gate            below threshold: ask, don't guess
 *     -> service match              real catalogue rows
 *     -> temple match               location priority honoured
 *     -> pandit eligibility+ranking deterministic, code not model
 *     -> LLM                        explains what was already decided
 *     -> persist + analytics
 *
 * Ordering is not incidental. Safety precedes everything so a person in crisis
 * is never routed into an upsell. The confidence gate precedes matching so a
 * misunderstood question never produces confident-looking cards. The LLM is
 * last and receives a finished shortlist, so it cannot invent inventory.
