/** Every publicly indexable entity URL, with its own updated_at for
 *  <lastmod> — matches the same visibility gates the public list/detail
 *  endpoints already use (temples.repository.js, services.repository.js,
 *  pandits.repository.js), so nothing appears in the sitemap that a visitor
 *  couldn't actually browse to.
 *
 *  Also applies the Phase 11 indexability engine's thin-content rule
 *  (backend/src/utils/indexability.js) — a visible-but-thin entity gets
 *  `noindex` on its own page, and was still being listed here regardless,
 *  telling crawlers to index a page that explicitly tells them not to (Phase
 *  12 technical SEO batch, docs/SEO_ARCHITECTURE.md). Expressed directly in
 *  SQL rather than calling isTempleIndexable/isServiceIndexable/
 *  isPanditIndexable per row — those expect each entity's full getBySlug()
 *  shape, and running that per row for a sitemap covering ~1,000+ pandits
 *  would mean 1,000+ extra queries; the WHERE clauses below are the exact
 *  same signals (same 40-char meaningful-text threshold, same
 *  verified-status gate, same relationship checks), just computed in bulk. */
