 * picture still showed stock artwork on /temples while the detail page showed
 * the real photo. The LATERAL join resolves the uploaded profile picture and
 * falls back, in order, to the first uploaded photo and then the legacy column.
 *
 * `temples` is deliberately left unaliased: list() composes WHERE fragments
 * that reference `temples.id` by name, and aliasing the table would break them.
 * The subquery exposes only `media_url`, so the bare column names in the
 * SELECT list stay unambiguous.
