 *
 * Also deactivates any OTHER still-active subscription row for the same
 * pandit — without this, a renewal or plan change would leave two rows
 * with is_active = TRUE, which is exactly the "conflicting simultaneous
 * entitlement" state a single pandit must never be in.
 *
 * MUST run with RLS opened (q bound via withSetting('app.webhook_verified',

 * matching rows are governed by that RLS the same way a SELECT would be —
 * calling this with the plain unscoped `query` silently matches ZERO rows
 * (no error, rowCount 0) rather than throwing, so the payment would stay
 * "pending" forever even though pandit_subscriptions did activate (that
 * table carries no RLS). Caught by tests/payments.test.js.
 *
 * The pandits.current_tier promotion goes through the SECURITY DEFINER
 * activate_pandit_subscription() (migration 29), NOT a plain UPDATE — a
 * webhook has neither a pandit's own session identity nor an admin one, so
 * it satisfies NEITHER pandits_update_self NOR pandits_update_admin, and a
 * bare UPDATE here would silently match zero rows exactly like the
 * payment_transactions issue above. See migration 29's comment for the full
 * story — this was a real, always-broken bug (no Razorpay account has ever
 * been configured on this project to exercise the path).
